export const ROLE = [
  "Risheh is one of the projects that was born in Thirdline Studio from the very beginning. The studio, as the project's founder, took responsibility for the entire process from the ideation stage, problem definition, team building, stock model formulation, and development path design.",
  "We started from the 'Discovery' phase with field research, stakeholder map development, in-depth interviews, and market analysis. Later, the business model, brand identity, user experience design, service architecture, and growth scenarios were designed by the studio team in the 'Creation' phase.",
  "Next, by forming the technical and operational team, we entered the MVP development phase and simultaneously formulated and implemented the ESOP strategy to attract and retain specialists. The fundraising process was also fully handled by the studio, and we successfully secured the initial seed capital from Fakher Holding.",
  "Risheh is now in the initial product development stage, and Thirdline Studio remains with the team as a growth strategist, infrastructure developer, and commercialization partner.",
