            Risheh is one of the projects that was born in Thirdline Studio from
            the very beginning. As the project&apos;s founder, the studio took
            responsibility for the entire process, from ideation, problem
            definition, team building, and stock model formulation to designing
            the development path. We started the &apos;Discovery&apos; phase
            with field research, stakeholder mapping, in-depth interviews, and
            market analysis. Subsequently, the business model, brand identity,
            user experience design, service architecture, and growth scenarios
            were designed by the studio team in the &apos;Creation&apos; phase.
            Next, by forming the technical and operational team, we entered the
            MVP development phase and simultaneously developed and implemented
            the ESOP strategy to attract and retain specialists. The fundraising
            process was also fully handled by the studio, and we successfully
            secured the initial seed capital from Fakher Holding. Risheh is now
            in the initial product development stage, and Thirdline Studio
            remains with the team as a growth leader, infrastructure developer,
            and commercialization partner.
